# **University.Solution**
Project Initiated: 2021-01-04<br>
Updated: 2021-01-04

## **Project Description**

This project was created to help us further our knowledge with using join statements to help connect tables in our database. We also were able to get additional practice with using many to many relationships with our tables in our datababse. This application is a univeristy registrar that helps keep track of students and courses. Here is a breakdown of the features it has, their functionality, and their benefits.
* As a registrar, you will be able to enter a student, to help keep track of all students enrolled at this University. The student will be able to provide their name and their date of enrollment.
* As a registrar, you will be able to enter a course, so you can keep track of all of the courses the University offers. You should be able to provide a course name and a course number (ex. HIST100).
* As a registrar, you will to be able to assign students to a course, so that teachers know which students are in their course. A course can have many students and a student can take many courses at the same time.



## **Required for Use**
* C# and .Net Core installed on your local machine. (Developed on .Net Core v2.2.4)
* Console/Terminal access.
* Code Editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)


## **Installation Instructions**
Download .Net Core from the following link and follow the installation instructions.
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download


### **Installing C#, .NET, dotnet script,**
Install C# and .Net according to your operating system below:

**For Mac**
1. Download this .NET Core SDK Software Development Kit. 
2. Open the .pkg file. This will launch an installer which will walk you through installation steps. Use the default settings the installer suggests.
3. Confirm the installation is successful by opening your terminal and running the command <code>$ dotnet --version</code>, which should return the correct version number.

**For Windows (10+)**
1. Download either the the 64-bit .NET Core SDK Software Development Kit
2. Open the file and follow the steps provided by the installer for your OS.
3. Confirm the installation is successful by opening a new Windows PowerShell window and running the command <code>dotnet --version</code> You should see a response with the correct version number.

Install dotnet script with the following terminal command dotnet tool install: 

<code>dotnet-script</code>

**My SQL** 

1) Download and install [MySQL Community Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
 
2) Download and install [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)

**Windows 10 -**

Start by downloading the MySQL Web Installer from the [MySQL Downloads](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484919) page. (Use the No thanks, just start my download link.)

Follow along with the installer:

1) Click "Yes" if prompted to update.
2) Accept license terms.
3) Choose Custom setup type.
4) When prompted to Select Products and Features, choose the following:
* MySQL Server 8.0.19 (This will be under "MySQL Servers > MySQL Server > MySQL Server 8.0")

* MySQL Workbench 8.0.19 (This will be under "Applications > MySQL Workbench > MySQL Workbench 8.0")

5) Select "Next", then "Execute". Wait for download and installation. (This can take a few minutes.)

6) Advance through Configuration as follows:

* High Availability set to "Standalone".

* "Defaults are OK" under Type and Networking.

* Authentication Method set to Use Legacy Authentication Method.

* Set password to something you will remember. 

* Defaults are OK under Windows Service. Make sure that checkboxes are checked for the options "Configure MySQL Server as a Windows Service" and "Start the MySQL Server at System Startup". Under Run Windows Service as..., the "Standard System Account" should be selected.

7) Complete Installation process.
Next, add the MySQL environment variable to the System PATH. We must include MySQL in the System Environment Path Variable. This is its own multi-step process:

8) Open the Control Panel and visit System and "Security > System". Select "Change Settings" and a pop-up window will display. Select the tab "Advanced" and select the "Environment Variables" button.
9) Within the System Variables navigator window, select PATH..., click Edit..., and then New.

10) Add the exact location of your MySQL installation, and click OK. (This location is likely C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin, but may differ depending on your specific installation.)

**MacOS -**

Start by downloading the MySQL Community Server .dmg file from the [MySQL Community Server page](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484914). Click the download icon. Use the No thanks, just start my download link.

Next, follow along with the Installer until you reach the Configuration page. Once you've reached Configuration, select or set the following options (use default if not specified):

1) Use Legacy Password Encryption.

2)  Set password to something you will remember.

3) Click Finish.

4) Open the terminal and enter the command echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile. This will save this path in .bash_profile, which is where our terminal is configured.

5) Type in source ~/.bash_profile (or restart the terminal) in order to actually verify that MySQL was installed.

Next, verify MySQL installation by opening terminal and entering the command mysql -uroot -pepicodus. You'll know it's working and connected if you gain access and see the MySQL command line. If it's not working, you'll likely get a -bash: mysql: command not found error.

You can exit the mysql program by entering exit.

Next, download the MySQL Workbench .dmg file from the MySQL Workbench page. (Use the No thanks, just start my download link.)

Install MySQL Workbench to Applications folder.

Then open MySQL Workbench and select the Local instance 3306 server. You will need to enter the password you set. (We used epicodus.) If it connects, you're all set.
